#
# Allowed Initiators - Generated by Chef - local changes will be overwritten
#
# The semantics are:
#
# * Without any entries no initiator can see or connect to any target.
#
# * By default we allow all initiators to connect to all targets with
#   the "ALL ALL" entry.
#
# * Override which initiators can connect to which targets by putting an
#   entry for a given target followed by a comma separated list of
#   initiators, either IP address or IQN name (basic regex patterns for
#   IQN names are accepted leave out ^ and $ specials as they are implicit),
#   separate the two with whitespace.
#
# * Entry processing stops at the "ALL" target entry if present.
