#
# Allowed Targets - Generated by Chef - local changes will be overwritten
#
# The semantics are:
#
# * Without any entries no target will accept connections or be discovered
#   on any address.
#
# * By default we allow all targets to accept connections and to be
#   discovered on any address with the "ALL ALL" entry.
#
# * Override which targets will accept connections on and be discovered on
#   which addresses by putting an entry for a given target followed by a
#   comma separated list of IP addresses, separate the two with whitespace.
#
# * Entry processing stops at the "ALL" target entry if present.
